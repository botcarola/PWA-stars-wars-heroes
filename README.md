# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}

## Progressive Web App (PWA) with Vite

This project is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Vite. The PWA capabilities enable offline access and improved performance through caching strategies.

### PWA Configuration

To take full advantage of the PWA features:

1. **Service Worker**: Configure a Service Worker to cache assets and provide offline support. Use strategies like `CacheFirst` or `NetworkFirst` from Workbox to optimize resource loading.

2. **Manifest File**: Create a `manifest.json` file to define your app's metadata, such as its name, icons, and theme colors. This file helps in installing the app on a user's device and ensures a native-like experience.

3. **Offline Access**: Ensure critical assets and data are cached so that users can access your app even without an internet connection. Implement fallback strategies for network requests to maintain functionality.

By leveraging these PWA capabilities, your application can deliver a reliable and engaging experience to users across various devices and network conditions.
